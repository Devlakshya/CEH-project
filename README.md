# Network Penetration Testing with Real-World Exploits and Security Remediation

## Project by: \[LAKSHYA BORIKAR]

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a real-world network penetration testing simulation using Kali Linux as the attacker machine and Metasploitable as the target. The primary goal is to identify security vulnerabilities, exploit them ethically, and apply remediation techniques to secure the system.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand and apply the phases of penetration testing.
* Use tools like Nmap and Metasploit for reconnaissance and exploitation.
* Enumerate services and identify system vulnerabilities.
* Perform privilege escalation and hash cracking.
* Implement remediation steps to secure vulnerable services.

---

## 🖥 Requirements

* *Kali Linux* (Attacker)
* *Metasploitable* (Target)

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

* *Nmap* – Network scanning and OS/service enumeration
* *Metasploit Framework* – Exploitation and privilege escalation
* *John the Ripper* – Password hash cracking
* *Linux terminal utilities* – User management and file manipulation

---

## 🛠 What I Learned

* Performing active and passive network reconnaissance using Nmap.
* Detecting open and hidden ports along with running services.
* Exploiting vulnerable services through Metasploit modules.
* Creating a new root-level user and understanding privilege escalation.
* Extracting password hashes from /etc/shadow and cracking them with John.
* The critical importance of keeping software updated and secure.

---

## 🔐 Remediation Highlights

* Identified outdated software (e.g., vsftpd 2.3.4, OpenSSH 4.7p1).
* Recommended updating to secure versions (e.g., OpenSSH 9.x+).
* Suggested disabling unused services and ports.
* Emphasized the use of secure password hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA-512).
